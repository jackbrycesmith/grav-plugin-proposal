# 📝 Proposal Plugin for [Grav CMS](https://github.com/getgrav/grav)

This plugin provides additional functionality to Grav that could help you avoid the pains of a traditional sales process:

1. *Write your proposal as a `.doc` or `.pdf`*
2. *Email it your client*
3. *Wait for a response...*
4. *If they agree, wait for them to bank transfer a deposit...*

You can **make it easier for your client to say yes** to whatever you are proposing if you:

1. Write your proposal as a 🔐 page on your website
2. Support your words with embedded media 📹🖼️
3. Let them instantly agree & pay the deposit by 💳 

This idea isn't completely new as a number of paid online proposal services already exist. See how you could achieve comparable results with Grav & the Proposal Plugin:

## How it works

After you have [installed the Proposal Plugin](#installation), add [your Stripe Publishable & Secret keys](https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard#api-keys) - this can be done through the Admin Panel:

![proposal-config-screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13235268/31609132-d1d643ea-b26a-11e7-887b-117dfb25628a.png)

Then set what currency you want to receive deposits in:

> ⚠️ To support Apple Pay you need to [complete an additional verification step](https://stripe.com/docs/elements/payment-request-button#verifying-your-domain-with-apple-pay) 

Now you'll be able to **write your proposals in markdown** (`proposal.md`) that will use a self-contained template (`proposal.html.twig`) to transform them into attractive pages that **look & read great on any device**.

### Template features

  - table of contents (inc. smooth scroll to sections) generated from `##` `###` section headings in your proposal
  - images/video can stretch to full width (medium.com-esque) 
  - uses system fonts for performance
  - `>` make quotes that stand out
  - highlight important points with `<mark>Important Point</mark>`

### Proposal options

- Select an image to cover the opening section
- Decide how much of a deposit you want the client to make to accept the proposal in the page frontmatter e.g. `deposit: 700`
- Choose who you want to be able to access the page, thanks to the [Login plugin](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-login)
